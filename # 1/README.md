## Shell Programming
Simple Shell programs. Create files and directories wherever necessory, since some scripts require them.

## Compile Shell Scripts
Shell Scripts don't need compilation. They are interpreter based.

Run Shell Scripts using:

`bash script.sh`

Or make the Shell Script executable using command:

`sudo chmod +x script.sh`

Then run the file directly using:

`./script.sh`
